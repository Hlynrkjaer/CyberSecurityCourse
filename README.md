# CyberSecurityCourse
<sub>cybersecuritybase-project ( task from https://cybersecuritybase.github.io/ -- Course Project One -- )</sub>
<hr />
There will be <strong>check-steps</strong>:
<ul>
<li>for improve design,</li>
<br />
<li>adding some features and</li>
<br />
<li>other related steps (with additional steps for troublepoints-usage) to my project-application.</li>
<br />
</ul>
Some kind of documentation for first design of this task available with next <a href="https://github.com/marrbjorn/documentation/tree/master/F-Secure%20Cyber%20Security%20Base%20MOOC.fi%20-First%20Project" target="_blank">URL</a>

# FIRST EXTEND-STEPS TO MY PROJECT APPLICATION:


<strong>--></strong> There added "http.headers()"-disabled-point; and "http.cors()"-disabled-point;

<strong>--></strong> Small "add"-point as some kind of "mapping" (trick-feature); 

--
First one provide some kind of ability to "improve" troubles with security configuration.

      As result there will be disabled most of common "headers" and features, which good to have "enabled";
      
      And.. there is just "disabled" option under the Spring; 
      But will be more interesting to work with custom-ones;
      
      Basically should be required to work with "custom"..
      if we want to disable/change some of "headers"-features!
      
--
Second one provide some kind of potential troublepoint with Unvalidated Redirects.

      With current view: this is just kind of "trick"-feature;
      But provide additional steps to "play" with project-application;
      
      Also this is partly can be related with extend-steps for adding the next "vulnerable"-point.
      Which can be covered by Trouble Ten from OWASP TOP TEN..
